# AI Adoption in Life Sciences: Key Findings (KPMG 2025 Report)

## Strategic Prioritization
- **Executive Focus:** 64% of life sciences CEOs prioritize AI investments (KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook).
- **Core Drivers:** Speeding up drug discovery, predicting clinical trial outcomes, and personalizing medicine.

## Human-AI Delegation & Integration
- **Research Acceleration:** AI is used to design and customize artificial proteins (e.g., Jin Kim Montclare's lab at NYU).
- **Task Delegation:**
    - **AI Tasks:** Data analysis of vast datasets, predictive analytics for patient risk, automating product labeling, and responding to health authority inquiries.
    - **Human Role:** Oversight, ethical validation, and managing the "black box" complexity.
- **Operational Efficiency:** GenAI is utilized to monitor supply chain risks, forecast demand, and streamline corporate functions (finance, HR, IT).

## Key Challenges & Risks
- **Data Integrity:** Quantity and quality of training data are critical.
- **Privacy:** Protecting sensitive patient information (PHI) remains a top concern.
- **Bias:** Potential for AI models to amplify biases (e.g., historical underrepresentation of women in clinical trials).
- **Transparency:** Need for explainability in AI-driven decisions to meet regulatory standards (FDA).

## Institutional Practices
- Leading labs are moving from "BT and IT" integration to an "AI for Science and Science for AI" paradigm.
- Focus on building a foundation for safe, ethical, and responsible AI adoption.

# AI in Universities: Empowerment vs. Dependence

## Institutional Integration (Harvard, MIT, Cambridge)
- **MIT:** Focus on "AI for Science" to accelerate clinical research and biotech manufacturing.
- **Harvard:** Programs for healthcare leaders to implement AI and machine learning in real-world settings.
- **Cambridge:** Research on AI's role in pharmaceutical innovation and best practices for ML in biotech.

## Empowerment vs. Dependence
- **Empowerment:** AI as a "patient tutor" and "equal collaborator" that lightens the teacher's load and provides individualized support.
- **Dependence:** Concerns about the erosion of critical thinking, reliance on AI for shortcuts, and the "black box" nature of AI outputs.
- **Student Perspective:** Views AI as a dual role—empowering through efficiency but risking dependency if not used critically.

# The Arabic AI Challenge

## Linguistic Complexity
- **Diglossia:** The coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and diverse dialects makes it difficult for AI to communicate authentically across registers.
- **Morphology:** Arabic's complex morphology and dialectal variation lead to mishandling of grammar and pronunciation by current models.

## Data & Representation
- **Underrepresentation:** Arabic is underrepresented in many AI datasets, limiting the accuracy and depth of available tools.
- **Cultural Flattening:** AI often portrays "Arab culture" as a single entity, failing to reflect the diverse histories and lived experiences across the Arab world.

## Long-term Study Companions
- **Memory & Verification:** For a 5+ year companion, the output must be constantly verified by humans to ensure accuracy and cultural relevance.
- **Future Direction:** The goal is to move from blind reliance to a critical partnership where AI supports but does not replace human interaction.
